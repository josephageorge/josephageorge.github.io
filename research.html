    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p class="research-intro">
        My research sits at the intersection of predictive modeling, human decision-making, and complex systems.
        I’m interested in how people and institutions respond to incentives, how advantages are created and eroded
        over time, and what good statistical models can (and can’t) say about those processes.

                    At the Burning Glass Institute, I work on labor-market analytics and the
                    <em>Labor Matters</em> newsletter, which tracks trends in employment, education, and automation.
                    I analyze large-scale professional datasets and use text analytics to understand how opportunity,
                    skills, and “societal good” show up across industries and educational backgrounds.

                    Through my basketball analytics work and my blog, I study how teams create, trade, and defend
                    advantages over the course of a possession and a season. I’ve developed defensive versatility and
                    hustle metrics, as well as predictive models for rookie-scale contracts, shooting, and player
                    development, often blending tracking-style information with play-by-play data.
