        <p>
            A lot of basketball analytics has been a chase for a holy grail: one number that tells you how good a player actually is. Box score stats can't do it — they only capture what's easy to count. Metrics built on top of box scores inherit the same blind spots. The breakthrough was Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus, and the idea behind it is almost unreasonably simple: measure how the score changes when a player is on the court versus off it, adjust for who else is out there, and regularize so the noise doesn't eat you alive. What you get back is a single number that captures something the box score never could — a player's actual impact, stripped of context.
        </p>

        <p>
            RAPM shaped how I think about a lot of things, not just basketball. The lesson I take from it is that you don't need to be able to measure everything to learn something real. The box score misses most of what matters on a basketball court — screens, rotations, gravity, decision-making — and for a long time, people assumed that meant you couldn't quantify those things. RAPM showed that you could, indirectly, just by being clever about what you <i>do</i> observe. The signal was always there. It just needed a better question. I think that's true far more often than people realize, in a lot of domains — there's more signal sitting in existing data than we've figured out how to extract yet.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's the kind of problem-solving I care about. A lot of applied statistics operates in a world where the answer is "get more data," and that's often right. But the problems I find most interesting are the ones where more data alone doesn't get you very far — where samples are small, context shifts between settings, and the raw numbers can mislead you if you don't think carefully about what's generating them. The real work is structural: what should you actually measure, what's a fair comparison, how do you borrow strength where you don't have enough signal on your own. Basketball is full of problems like that, and it's a domain I know well enough to have good instincts about when something is off.

            Outside of basketball, I do research on AI and labor markets at the Burning Glass Institute. The overlap is less weird than it sounds — both are about understanding how systems evaluate people, and where those evaluations break down. I grew up reading about political forecasting and going on long Wikipedia spirals about basketball stats, and somehow that turned into actual work. This site is where I put it.
