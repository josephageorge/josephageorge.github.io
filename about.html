        <p>
            I get asked some version of “Why do you do what you do?” a lot, mostly because my work doesn’t sit neatly in one lane. On paper, it can look a little scattered: sports analytics is unconventional on its own, and labor economics seems—at first glance—completely unrelated. Both are also recent developments. I only started doing consistent external work in either area in 2024. For most of my life, even majoring in something adjacent felt unlikely. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I generally believed that enjoying your work was something that came by fate. I knew it was possible, in theory, but never felt like it was a median outcome for me. More specifically, I didn’t grow up expecting to build basketball models. I just kept following whatever questions I couldn’t shake.
        </p>

        <p>
            That tendency started early. In middle school, I spent a fair amount of time reading about political modeling. In high school, I competed seriously in 
            <a href="https://hdwhite.org/qb/stats/player/%22Joseph+George%22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiz Bowl</a>
            and adjacent competitions. I spent hours on Wikipedia spirals and basketball statistics. It was just a collection of my interests - things I had curiosity towards.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Over time, the pattern broke through. Whether in sports or economics, I kept drifting toward the same themes: the structures that shape incentives and outcomes. I liked chasing questions until they gave up something useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            So the “unconventional” part of my background has never been a detour; it’s just the consequence of following my questions across different domains. Whether I’m working on NBA metrics or labor-market trends, I’m ultimately focused on the same core idea: that human behavior is measurable enough to model, but messy enough to stay interesting.

            Hopefully, this site is a home for that kind of work — some polished, some experimental — and a way to keep pushing on the questions that got me started. If nothing else, it'll be a record of my trying to take curiosity seriously, even when the path it creates isn’t linear.
